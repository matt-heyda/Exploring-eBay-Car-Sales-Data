# Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

This project aims to clean and analyse a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset that will be used for this project is a modified version of the one found here. The data was modified in the following ways:
*Only 50,000 data points were sampled from the full dataset.
*The dataset was "dirtied" to more closely resemble what would be expected from a pre-cleaned, scraped dataset.
